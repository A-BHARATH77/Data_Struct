## Supported Data Structures

1. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:  
   - Perform insertion, deletion, and search operations.  
   - Visualize the hierarchical tree structure dynamically.  

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:  
   - Traverse graphs layer by layer.  
   - Observe the step-by-step visualization of the traversal process.  

3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:  
   - Explore nodes in a depth-first order.  
   - Highlight backtracking steps during traversal for better understanding.
