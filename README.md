Overview
The Data Structures Calculator is an interactive and educational platform designed to help students learn and visualize data structures and algorithms.

Dynamically input data to create and manipulate structures.
Visualize operations and validate algorithmic properties in real time.
Designed for intuitive and engaging learning through hands-on experience and detailed visual feedback.
Features
Dynamic Data Input
Build and test data structures with your own data.
Visualization of Algorithms
Real-time visualizations of processes such as traversal and search.
Supported Data Structures
Binary Search Tree (BST):
Insert, delete, and search nodes.
Visualize the tree structure.
Breadth-First Search (BFS):
Traverse graphs layer by layer.
Step-by-step traversal visualization.
Depth-First Search (DFS):
Explore nodes in depth-first order.
Highlight backtracking steps during traversal.
Educational Purpose
Understand the inner workings of data structures.
Validate the correctness of algorithms with real-time feedback.
