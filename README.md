Data Structures Calculator
Overview
The Data Structures Calculator is an interactive and educational platform designed to assist students in learning and visualizing various data structures and algorithms. The platform allows users to dynamically input data, create and manipulate structures, visualize their operations, and validate algorithmic properties in real-time.

This project aims to make learning complex data structures intuitive and engaging by providing hands-on experience and detailed visual feedback.

Features
Dynamic Data Input: Users can provide their own data to build and test data structures.
Visualization of Algorithms: Real-time visualizations of processes such as traversal and search.
Supported Data Structures:
Binary Search Tree (BST):
Insert, delete, and search nodes.
Visualize the tree structure.
Breadth-First Search (BFS):
Traverse graphs layer by layer.
Step-by-step visualization of the traversal order.
Depth-First Search (DFS):
Explore nodes in depth-first order.
Highlight backtracking steps during traversal.
Educational Purpose:
Understand how data structures work internally.
Validate the correctness of algorithms with real-time feedback.
Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Django (Python)
Visualization Tools: JavaScript-based libraries for interactive animations and graphics
Deployment: Compatible with modern browsers for seamless user experience
